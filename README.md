# Data Visualization Guide

This document outlines various types of data and their corresponding visualization techniques.

## Types of Data

### Categorical Data
This type of data groups values into categories. There are two subtypes:
- **Nominal:** Labels without any inherent order.  
  *Example:* Types of fruits (apple, banana, cherry).
- **Ordinal:** Categories with a specific order, but no exact difference between them.  
  *Example:* Movie ratings (poor, good, excellent).

### Numerical Data
Represents data with numbers, and is divided into:
- **Discrete:** Countable numbers.  
  *Example:* Number of students in a class.
- **Continuous:** Can take any value within a range.  
  *Example:* Height of students (measured in cm).

## Choosing a Visualization

When selecting a chart for your data, consider the following:
- **Avoid complex plots:** Simple visuals are usually better.
- **Choose charts that are easy to interpret:** Donâ€™t pick visuals that could confuse the reader.
- **Limit color usage:** Using more than 3 colors in a chart is discouraged. Use a tool like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to choose a color palette.

## Types of Charts

### 1. Bar Chart
- **Use for:** Comparing categorical data.
- **Description:** Uses rectangular bars to represent values. The length of each bar corresponds to the data value.
- **Best for:** Comparing quantities across categories (e.g., revenue by product).
- **Example:** Comparing revenue by product type.

### 2. Pie Chart
- **Use for:** Showing proportions or percentages.
- **Description:** Circular chart divided into slices, each representing a proportion of the whole.
- **Best for:** Displaying the composition of something (e.g., market share).
- **Example:** Market share of smartphone brands.

### 3. Area Chart
- **Use for:** Showing cumulative trends over time.
- **Description:** Similar to a line chart, but the area beneath the line is filled with color to show cumulative totals.
- **Best for:** Visualizing how different components add up over time.
- **Example:** Cumulative revenue from product categories over time.

### 4. Line Chart
- **Use for:** Showing trends over time.
- **Description:** Displays data points connected by straight lines, ideal for tracking changes over time.
- **Best for:** Time series data (e.g., stock prices or website traffic).
- **Example:** Monthly sales trends.

### 5. Histogram
- **Use for:** Showing the distribution of numerical data.
- **Description:** Groups numerical data into intervals, showing how many data points fall within each interval (bins).
- **Best for:** Understanding data distribution.
- **Example:** Distribution of salaries in a company.

### 6. Scatter Plot
- **Use for:** Showing relationships between two variables.
- **Description:** Displays individual data points on a two-dimensional grid, with each variable on its respective axis.
- **Best for:** Analyzing correlations (e.g., height vs. weight).
- **Example:** Relationship between advertising spend and revenue.

### 7. Regression Plot
- **Use for:** Highlighting the relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Description:** A scatter plot with a line that represents the best fit (linear or polynomial) through the data points.
- **Best for:** Predicting or visualizing trends.
- **Example:** Correlation between hours studied and exam scores.

### 8. Bar-Line Chart (Combination Chart)
- **Use for:** Comparing categorical data with a trend over time.
- **Description:** Combines a bar chart with a line chart. Bars represent one data set (categorical), and the line shows trends.
- **Best for:** Visualizing the relationship between categories and trends.
- **Example:** Monthly revenue (bars) and profit percentage (line).
